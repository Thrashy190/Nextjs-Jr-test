## Getting Started

This version of Next.js requires node 14.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Tailwind

This project also utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Please style your components using Tailwind classes ONLY.

**DO NOT create custom CSS classes unless absolutely necessary.**

I would recommend reading their docs and installing their editor plugin for editor hinting.

## Requirements

You are to re-create a new dashboard page using **ONLY NextJS, React, & Tailwind**.

I should be able to access this page from http://localhost:3000/dashboard.

Do not worry about re-creating the header or the footer.

Only these sections:

![Design 1](./public/img/mock-1.png)
![Design 2](./public/img/mock-2.png)

Design must also be **MOBILE FRIENDLY!**

Upon completion, please share the github link to the cloned/forked project.
